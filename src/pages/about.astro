        <div class="content">
          <p>
            With four years of experience in full-stack web development and team leadership,
            I bring a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and management to every project I undertake.
            My passion for continuous learning and self-improvement drives me to take on new challenges and contribute to the success of the teams and organizations I work with.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem">
            Currently, I am a Project Leader at Click-on, where I lead the development of a Spring Boot application that serves as the backend for a mobile app,
            ensuring high performance and scalability. In addition I develop partner integrations using Oracle PL/SQL and Java EE.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem">
            Previously, I served as a Lead Developer at Netopgraf, where I worked as a full-stack developer for web applications built with PHP and JavaScript.
            I also managed and mentored a team of 2-3 developers, performing code reviews and providing guidance to ensure high-quality deliverables.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem">
            Beyond my technical roles, I have experience teaching programming to elementary school children at Logischool.
            This role enhanced my communication skills and ability to explain complex concepts in an accessible way.
            Additionally, my part-time logistics work at Magura Event Kft. taught me the importance of organization, teamwork,
            and adaptability—skills that continue to benefit my career in development and leadership.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem">
            With a blend of technical expertise, leadership experience, and a commitment to growth,
            I am dedicated to delivering innovative solutions and fostering collaboration within any team.
