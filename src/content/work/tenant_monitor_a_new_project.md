    Tenant Monitor is an exciting project that started as a SaaS business idea designed to simplify communication and collaboration between apartment owners and tenants. With the aim of creating a seamless platform for managing rental properties, we’ve made significant strides in development—overcoming challenges and learning valuable lessons along the way.

### The Vision: A Platform to Connect Owners and Tenants
Imagine a platform where apartment owners can effortlessly share important information about their properties with tenants, and tenants can communicate their requests with ease. This was the core idea behind Tenant Monitor.

Using the web app, owners can upload property data—such as size, maintenance schedules, and lease terms—and invite tenants to join. Tenants, in turn, can view this information, request maintenance, or provide updates. Our goal was to create a user-friendly and efficient system to make property management less of a hassle for everyone involved.

#### The Development Journey
The project began with a robust tech stack that included Java Spring for backend development, MySQL for the database, and Vaadin for the initial frontend. Here’s how we approached each stage of the project:

#### Backend Success
We successfully implemented a proof of concept (PoC) for the backend, ensuring that the platform could handle essential data flows, user authentication, and seamless communication between tenants and owners. The backend provided a strong foundation for the app, built to scale and adapt as the project grows.

#### Frontend Challenges with Vaadin
Initially, we chose Vaadin for the frontend because of its simplicity and integration with Java. While it allowed us to create a functional UI quickly, we soon realized that Vaadin's component-based framework lacked the flexibility and modernity needed for our vision. This led us to pivot and begin redesigning the frontend using React, a library better suited for dynamic, interactive web applications.

### Moving Forward with React
React has opened new possibilities for Tenant Monitor’s frontend. With its rich ecosystem, modularity, and responsiveness, React allows us to build a user interface that’s not only visually appealing but also highly intuitive for both apartment owners and tenants.

We’re actively working on this redesign, prioritizing usability and scalability to ensure a great user experience as we move toward a functional MVP.

#### Key Features: What Tenant Monitor Will Offer
Once complete, Tenant Monitor will feature:

 - Property Information Dashboard
Owners can upload and manage property details, accessible to tenants with just a click.

 - Tenant Invitations
Owners can invite tenants to join their properties on the platform, simplifying onboarding.

 - Maintenance Scheduling
A shared space to log maintenance dates and notify tenants about upcoming work.

 - Request System
Tenants can submit maintenance or service requests directly through the app, keeping communication clear and organized.

 - Lessons Learned
This journey has taught us some valuable lessons about development and project management:

#### Choosing the right tools for each part of a project is critical.
While Vaadin served us initially, React is proving to be a better fit for our needs.
A strong backend can sustain pivots and frontend redesigns, ensuring continuity in development.
Iteration and feedback are essential to refining our vision and building a solution that truly meets user needs.
What’s Next?
With the backend firmly in place and React powering our frontend redesign, Tenant Monitor is steadily progressing toward its goal of simplifying property management for owners and tenants. We’re excited about what’s to come and are eager to share updates as we roll out new features and move closer to launch.

Stay tuned as we continue this journey—Tenant Monitor is just getting started!
