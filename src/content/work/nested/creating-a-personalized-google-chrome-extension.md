### A Dedicated Manhwa Reader

Reading Manhwa has always been one of my favorite pastimes. I'm drawn to the beautiful artwork, compelling storylines, and the diverse range of genres. However, keeping track of the progress for long-running series with several seasons became a challenge, especially when some series would disappear for months or even years.

##### The Birth of an Idea

Initially, I thought of maintaining a manual list of the Manhwas I was reading and noting down the latest chapter I was on. But I quickly realized the potential pitfalls of this approach. There were chances I would forget to update the list, or maybe I would finish a chapter on my phone and run out of time to update my progress.

That's when it hit me - a Google Chrome extension that could automatically track my reading progress! I decided to create an extension that would store the list of currently reading Manhwas and the latest chapter read. Once the list is uploaded into the extension, it automatically listens for when I start reading a Manhwa and updates the current chapter based on the URL. The beauty of it was, it only updated the current chapter if it was greater than the stored one, ensuring I never lose track of my reading progress.

##### The Exciting Journey

Developing this extension involved a thrilling journey of brainstorming features, researching, and learning necessary technologies. The extension is entirely written in JavaScript. The process of learning about and working with Google extensions was fascinating and enriching.

From having a simple idea to watching it come to life was a truly rewarding experience. It brought together my love for reading Manhwa and my passion for coding, and solved a real problem I was facing.

And the best part? This personalized Google Chrome extension is now a handy tool that ensures I can always dive right back into the world of Manhwa, picking up precisely where I left off.
