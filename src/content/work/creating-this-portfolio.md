  Embarking on the journey to create my own portfolio was nothing short of an adventure. It started from humble beginnings, with just plain JavaScript and HTML, but soon grew to something much more complex and exciting.

### The Early Days

The initial plan was simple. I wanted to use the tools I was most familiar with: JavaScript and HTML. The goal was to construct a portfolio that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. However, as the development process unfolded, I realized that the design aspect was a much more complex challenge than I had anticipated. The struggle to create a visually engaging portfolio that still retained simplicity and elegance was a significant roadblock.

##### Diving into <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>

Realizing the limitations of my initial approach, I decided to switch gears. This was when <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, a modern front-end framework, came into the picture. To get a better grasp of component-based web frameworks, I immersed myself in <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>'s ecosystem by completing their first blog tutorial.

This newfound knowledge allowed me to take a different approach to creating my portfolio. I attempted to construct it from scratch using <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>. While the experience was educational and I learned a lot, I had to face another reality - it's hard to create an engaging and professional design from scratch.

##### Discovering the Perfect Template

However, all the hurdles I faced led me to a great solution - finding the perfect template. The benefit of using a pre-existing template is that the layout, design, and responsiveness are already taken care of. This allowed me to focus on what I truly wanted to show - my skills, projects, and personality.

Starting for the third time, I used an <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> template and began molding it to my specifications. This time, it was a smoother process. Having already understood <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> and the structure of the template, my focus was on tailoring the content to reflect my career journey, skills, and aspirations.

##### Conclusion

Creating this portfolio has been a journey of discovery, learning, and growth. It was not just about showcasing my work and skills, but also about overcoming challenges, trying out new tools, and always striving for improvement. Through all this, I have grown as a developer and a problem-solver. In the end, I believe the portfolio stands as a testament to my ability to adapt, learn, and craft solutions.
